# linux_device_driver

This repo generally is created for exploring the Linux Kernel Modules and Linux Device Drivers.

To start up with the process I used my Laptop Lenovo Yoga, instead of any development board e.g (Pi, or other )or I might switch back to other development board where I will have easy access of GPIO ports for performing some applications.

Through the entire process I am trying to explore on these topics

1. Simple Kernel Module
2. Device Number and Device Files
3. Creating a device file in driver and callbacks
4. GPIO Drivers 
5. Text LCD Drivers
